# Synapse
stuff for synapse x


## Support
Originally grabbed from my [tamper monkey script collection](https://github.com/pozm/TamperMonkeyScripts)

I plan on extending it in the future under specific conditions.

## Wiki
The wiki is basically cloned from LoukaMB's old synapse repo. 

There may be a few imperfections with the copy (due to it being by hand)

I may extend this with useful information especially for SX-Lib.


# post

synapse as of 09/05/2021 is corrupt in my eyes so i will not be contributing to this repo or anything of the kind.
